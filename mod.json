    "description": "This mod will add a little tab to your game, what is it for? It adds some options for a sandbox experience such as giving yourself items, money, experience and more! I actively will add suggestions to the mod.Most of the time if the mod does not work it is not my fault but the game, try to remember the game is in early access and is made by one person, so don't be too harsh! P.S. - I am not responsible if your computer explodes or anything happens to your save file!"
